XRayScatterPy is a Python package for processing and analyzing x-ray scattering, grazing incidence x-ray scattering (GISAXS), and x-ray reflectivity data. It can process neutron scattering data in transmission and grazing incidence geometry. The package provides functionalities for reading raw image data, performing calibrations, plotting scattering data in 2D and 1D, calculating beam divergence, extracting specular reflectivity, fitting data with models, and assisting in thin film grating metrology. We intend to integrate bornagain package into this package in future developments. 
  
# Installation:
Python 3 is required for running the XRayScatterPy package. After downloading and unzipping the XRayScatterPy package, you can install it in a virtual environment using `pip` and the built-in `venv` module with terminal tools.  
For MacOS and Linux users, the system built-in terminal tool is recommanded; for Windows users, `git bash` is recommanded.  
In a terminal, firstly use `cd` command to navigate to the work directory, where you want to run your scripts and keep your data in.  
Then run the following commands in the terminal to create a virtual environment:
```
python -m venv <name_of_venv>
```
you can replace `<name_of_venv>` with an arbitrary name for the virtual environment, like `xrsp`.  
Next, activate the virtual environment with the following command,  
for MacOS and Linux, use:
```
source <name_of_venv>/bin/activate
```
for Windows, run in git bash:
```
source <name_of_venv>/Scripts/activate
```
Then install the downloaded package:
```
pip install <directory_to_package>
```
Replace `<directory_to_downloaded_package>` with the directory to the downloaded and unzipped package, for example: 
/Users/username/Documents/XRayScatterPy  
You can find out the currect directory with `pwd` command.

# Using the package:
For running the package, firstly navigate to the working directory and activate the virtual environment.
Then, write the python script with any text edit tool or IDE. you can find examples of scripts in `XRayScatterPy/examples/`.  
For example, `gisaxs.py` is an example script of processing raw GISAXS data; `transmission_scattering.py` is the example for generating 2D scattering patterns for transmission X-ray scattering measurements;  
then run the script with:
```
python script.py
```
